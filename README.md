# BB_Tree Main Memory Indexing
CSCE_614_Project. Implementing a BB Tree as stated in the original paper. 

## Environment Setup
Our environment uses g++ and openmp. Any unix environment should work (we used the TAMU server).

## Running the Simulations
All simulations are found in the mdrq-analysis/benchmarks folder. Each test suite has its own folder and is named accordingly the scripts for compiling and running the simulations are also in these folders.
*The genome and power datasets have been excluded for space.

## Simulator Source
The source of this simulation suite is from the original paper and can be found [here](https://www2.informatik.hu-berlin.de/~sprengsz/mdrq/).
